# Linear-Logistic-Regression
This repository includes the code for the python implementation of Linear and Logistic Regression models from scratch. Learning was performed in a variety of ways including but not limited to: analytical solutions, Gradient Descent, and Stochastic Gradient Descent.

## Data Used
- From Kaggle: Boston Housing Data
- From Ucirepo: Wine dataset

Data was cleaned and organized using pandas dataframes. **Note due to ethical considerations Col B from the Boston Housing was removed from the data.**

## Libraries Utilized
- pandas for data manipulation
- numpy for numerical manipulation
- Matplot for data visualization

The goal of this project was to get familiar with the concepts of Linear and Logistic Regression for linearlly sepearable data. The results of this project demonstrates the power of simple regression using a variety of techniques. A brief portion at the end of the project introduces Gaussian Bases to demonstrate how non-linear relationships can be rendered linear. All results and discussions are included in the report.
